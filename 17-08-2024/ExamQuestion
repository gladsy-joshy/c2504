Q: 
Create a `SurgicalProcedure` Class with Comparison Methods
- Task: Implement a class `SurgicalProcedure` that represents
a surgical procedure with properties `ProcedureID` and `Cost` (in dollars).
Implement the following methods:
`Equals`, `NotEquals`, `GreaterThan`,
`GreaterThanEquals`, `LessThan`, and `LessThanEquals`
to compare the costs of two surgical procedures.
- Requirements:
- Implement the `Equals(SurgicalProcedure other)` method to check
if two procedures have the same cost.
- Implement the `NotEquals(SurgicalProcedure other)` method to check
if two procedures have different costs.
- Implement the `GreaterThan(SurgicalProcedure other)` method to check
if one procedure is more expensive than another.
- Implement the `GreaterThanEquals(SurgicalProcedure other)` method to check
if one procedure is more expensive or the same price as another.
- Implement the `LessThan(SurgicalProcedure other)` method to check
if one procedure is less expensive than another.
- Implement the `LessThanEquals(SurgicalProcedure other)` method to check
if one procedure is less expensive or the same price as another.
- Example:
```csharp
SurgicalProcedure sp1 = new SurgicalProcedure("SP001", 5000);
SurgicalProcedure sp2 = new SurgicalProcedure("SP002", 4500);

Console.WriteLine(sp1.Equals(sp2)); // Output: False
Console.WriteLine(sp1.GreaterThan(sp2)); // Output: True
Console.WriteLine(sp1.LessThanEquals(sp2)); // Output: False




ANS:

using System;

class SurgicalProcedure
{
    public string ProcedureID { get; set; }
    public double Cost { get; set; }

    public SurgicalProcedure(string procedureID, double cost)
    {
        ProcedureID = procedureID;
        Cost = cost;
    }

    public bool Equals(SurgicalProcedure other) => Cost == other.Cost;

    public bool NotEquals(SurgicalProcedure other) => Cost != other.Cost;

    public bool GreaterThan(SurgicalProcedure other) => Cost > other.Cost;

    public bool GreaterThanEquals(SurgicalProcedure other) => Cost >= other.Cost;

    public bool LessThan(SurgicalProcedure other) => Cost < other.Cost;

    public bool LessThanEquals(SurgicalProcedure other) => Cost <= other.Cost;
}


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        SurgicalProcedure sp1 = new SurgicalProcedure("SP001", 5000);
        SurgicalProcedure sp2 = new SurgicalProcedure("SP002", 4500);

        Console.WriteLine(sp1.Equals(sp2));              
        Console.WriteLine(sp1.NotEquals(sp2));           
        Console.WriteLine(sp1.GreaterThan(sp2));         
        Console.WriteLine(sp1.GreaterThanEquals(sp2));  
        Console.WriteLine(sp1.LessThan(sp2));           
        Console.WriteLine(sp1.LessThanEquals(sp2));      
    }
}
